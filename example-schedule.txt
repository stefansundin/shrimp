# Example schedule file. Use "-schedule filename.txt" to use feature.
# See https://github.com/stefansundin/shrimp/discussions/4

# Lines starting with "#" are ignored.
# The schedule can include a default bandwidth limit (if omitted then unlimited is the default).
# The -bwlimit switch overrides the default value specified here.
# After the default, define a number of non-overlapping ranges that override the default.

# The format is:
# <weekday or weekday-range> <time-range>: <bwlimit>
# A "weekday" can be "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun", or their full names ("monday", "tuesday", etc).
# A "weekday-range", e.g. "mon-fri", applies the same rule to all days monday through friday.
# "time-range" is the time range that the bandwidth limit should apply, in 24 hour format, with leading zeroes if necessary.
# "bwlimit" is either "unlimited" or a fractional value ending with "k" or "m".
